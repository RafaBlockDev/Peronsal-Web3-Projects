# AI in Web3

On the POV os the arquitecture, the AI can adopte 3 components:

- TensorFlow.js : It enables machine learning models runnning and training inside browsers.
- Gradient descent : Smart contracts ca implement Gradient.
- Close-form : Smart contracts can also solve the machine learning model parameters in close-form.

## Algorithms

We can define 6 scenarios for AI adoption in Web3.0. The goal of this section is to figure out the theorical best practice among scenarios.

We can execute the AI at the frontend or also in the blockchain using smart contracts, here we have both alternatives:
